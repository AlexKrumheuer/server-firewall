## Features

### User Authentication
- Secure login and registration using password hashing
- **Forgot Password** and **Reset Password** functionality  
  **Note:** To enable the "Forgot Password" feature, you need to configure an email service.  
  This involves setting up an email account (e.g., Gmail) and generating an **App Password** or enabling "less secure app access" depending on your email provider.  
  You must add these email credentials (email address and app password) to your application's configuration so that password reset emails can be sent successfully.

### User Profile Management
- Edit firstname, lastname, username, and profile picture
- Manage user preferences

### Task Management
- Create, edit, and delete personal tasks

### Friends System
